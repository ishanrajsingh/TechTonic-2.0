Analysis Performed - 
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Statistical Analysis
4. Data Visualizations
Created 5 comprehensive visualizations:
a) Survival Distribution (Bar Chart)
Reveals low survival rate in this combined dataset
b) Age Distribution (Histogram)
Most passengers were between 20-40 years old
c) Survival Rate by Class and Gender (Grouped Bar Chart)
Highlights "women and children first" evacuation policy
d) Fare Distribution by Class (Scatter Plot)
Clear correlation: Higher class = Higher fare
e) Survival by Family Size (Bar Chart)
Traveling alone or in very large families reduced survival chances

Insights
1. Overall Statistics - Survival Rate, Average Age, Average Fare

2. Gender Disparity (Strongest Predictor) - Clear evidence of "women and children first" policy

3. Class-Based Survival (Second Strongest Predictor) - First-class passengers had 2.5x better survival than third-class

4. Port of Embarkation (Moderate Impact) - Cherbourg passengers had notably higher survival rates

5. Family Size Impact (Complex Relationship) - Having 2-4 family members aboard increased survival chances

6. Economic Factors - Economic status = Better cabin location = Better access to lifeboats

7. Combined Insights - Social status, gender, and family composition all significantly impacted survival
